    "Whatever I have up till now accepted as most true and assured I have gotten either from the senses or through the senses. But from time to time I have found that the senses deceive, and it is prudent never to trust completely those who have deceived us even once"


      â€”Rene Descartes, Meditations On First Philosophy


      "The C programming language's only failing is giving you access to what is really there, and telling you the cold hard raw truth. C gives you the red pill. C pulls the curtain back to show you the wizard. C is truth.

      Why use C then if it's so dangerous? Because C gives you power over the false reality of abstraction and liberates you from stupidity."

      -Zed Shaw
